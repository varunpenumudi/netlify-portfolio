        "full_description": `mymicrograd is my implementation of Andrej Karpathy's micrograd, a backpropagation and neural networks engine. This project provides a foundation for understanding the core concepts behind neural networks, gradient computation, and backpropagation in a simple, clean codebase.

## Features
- Back Propagation: Compute gradients for backpropagation through a computational graph.

- Custom Operations: Supports basic arithmetic operations along with activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Exp), and more.

- Neural Network Building: Create simple neural networks with layers and neurons, and perform forward and backward passes.

- Scalar Valued: This is a Scalar valued engine. Focused on clarity and simplicity, perfect for learning how neural networks and gradient descent work under the hood.`
